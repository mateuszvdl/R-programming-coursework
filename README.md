## Scripts Included

### 1. R Basics
* **File:** `01_r_basics.R`
* **Description:** An introductory script covering the fundamental syntax of R.
* **Topics Covered:**
    * Basic arithmetic operations.
    * Variable assignment using `<-`.
    * Creating numeric and character vectors with the `c()` function.
    * Loading packages with the `library()` function.

### 2. Data Frames and Importing Data
* **File:** `02_data_frames_and_import.R`
* **Description:** This script covers creating data sequences, addressing vectors, and the basics of working with data frames, including loading external data.
* **Topics Covered:**
    * Creating sequences with `seq()` and the `:` operator.
    * Indexing and subsetting vectors.
    * Handling special values like `NA`, `NaN`, and `Inf`.
    * Loading and inspecting a built-in data frame (`titanic` dataset).

## How to Run

To run these scripts, you will need to have R installed on your system. It is highly recommended to use an IDE like **RStudio**.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/R-programming-coursework.git](https://github.com/your-username/R-programming-coursework.git)
    cd R-programming-coursework
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username).*

2.  **Open in RStudio:**
    Open the `.R` files in RStudio. You can run the code line-by-line or execute the entire script to see the output in the console.
